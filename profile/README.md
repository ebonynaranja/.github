*"Unassuming on the outside, extraordinary on the inside"*

## What We Do
EbonyNaranja is a **research focused skunkworks**, exploring cutting edge technologies in **quantum computing**, **ternary computing**, **RISC-V**, or just fun applications.  Our mission is to push the boundaries of what is possible and innovate beyond the conventional. We like old school reliability with new school ideas. If it's useful, creative, or just plain cool, we’re into it.

## Skunkworks Areas of Exploration
Rather than organizing around a single technology, EbonyNaranja operates as a **skunkworks lab**. Current and emerging areas include:

- Quantum computing: concepts, models, tooling, and practical experiments around quantum computation.
- Ternary & non binary computing: alternatives to binary logic, including ternary systems and multivalued logic.
- RISC-V & open hardware: open instruction sets, firmware, low level systems, and experimental agents.
- Future work: many projects start as questions rather than plans. Some areas don’t have names yet; repositories may range from early sketches and simulators to fully working systems.

## Philosophy
EbonyNaranja isn’t a giant tech empire; it’s just us, building cool stuff because we love it.  
We focus on experimentation, long horizon research, and building working systems that challenge today’s assumptions; from hardware to protocols to tooling.  

Some ideas will fail.  
Some will evolve.  
Some may quietly influence future work.  

That’s the point.

## Our Name
At EbonyNaranja, we believe that true value lies beneath the surface. Inspired by the mythological golden apple, we reverse the narrative: we might look like an unassuming company, but we are packed with innovation, creativity, and transformative power. We create solutions that are as rich and vibrant as the orange at our core, and stable as the ebony on the outside.
