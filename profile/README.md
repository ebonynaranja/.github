**"Unassuming on the outside, extraordinary on the inside"**

## **About**
At EbonyNaranja, we believe that true value lies beneath the surface. Inspired by the mythological golden apple, we reverse the narrative: we might look like an unassuming company, but we are packed with innovation, creativity, and transformative power. We create solutions that are as rich and vibrant as the orange at our core, and stable as the ebony in our outside.


## **What We Do**

We build tech and tools that actually work—no drama, no corporate buzzwords. Whether it’s a terminal browser with some 1980s flavor or a clever backend nobody ever sees, we care about stuff that runs fast and feels good to use. Our projects look simple on the outside, but under the hood, they’re dialed in. We like old-school reliability with new-school ideas. If it’s useful, creative, or just plain cool, we’re into it; like RISC-V.


## **Why RISC-V?**

RISC-V is kind of like the new frontier—think Star Trek, but for hardware and open-source fans. There’s a reason so many folks are making the move: it’s open, flexible, and you don’t need a permission slip from a giant company just to build something great. We’re jumping in because we like being part of what’s next—not just following the crowd. If it means better tools for real work (or just more fun for tinkerers and researchers), we’re all in.


## **Why Choose Us?**

EbonyNaranja isn’t a giant tech empire—it’s just us, building cool stuff because we love it. We like solving problems, making things run smoother, and adding a little style along the way. Whether it’s a better terminal browser or a tool nobody asked for but everyone needs, we keep it simple and useful. No hype, just real work.
